# Node.js Express.js Asynchronous Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to asynchronous error handling in an Express.js application.  The application handles errors within an async middleware function; however, due to the nature of asynchronous operations and the timing of response sending, a subsequent attempt to send an error response might fail silently.

## Bug Description

The core issue is that once an Express.js response is sent, any further attempts to modify or send another response will result in an error, generally causing an unhandled exception or the error simply not being reported to the client.  This typically occurs when an error happens within an asynchronous operation after the initial response has been sent.  The `bug.js` file shows this behavior. 

## Solution

The solution, implemented in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this by using a flag variable to check whether the response has already been sent.  The error response is only sent if the response has not yet been sent.
